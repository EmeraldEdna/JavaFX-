# JavaFX-
JavaFX beginner App
This App was built with scenebuilder and inteliJ idea and 
It's my first JavaFX App tho its about a model agency forms sorta
And they get to say a bit more about their dreams and the file is saved in a .txt format
And later displayed to the user or the one filling the forms.
It's not too great and I hope I learn some more too.
